# To-Do-Application
## Develop REST APIs for a To-Do application that must include APIs to:
 
•	Create an event with name, description, date, and time (a field ‘status’ should be managed in the backend, the initial value of this would be ‘Pending’).
•	Update/delete an existing event.
•	Mark an event as ‘Completed’ (status update from Pending to Completed).
•	Get all the created events.
•	Provision to group the events by status in the above API:
o	‘Pending’ (initial status)
o	‘Overdue’ (If the event datetime is in the past and is not marked as Completed)
o	‘Completed’ (events marked as completed)
